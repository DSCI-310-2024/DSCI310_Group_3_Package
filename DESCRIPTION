Description: Convenient functions to run the project and adapt the workflow.
     lineplot: counts number of data points of each variable in a specific index 
               level, and plot the counts using a line.
     fetch_data:  takes a URl to a csv file online, whether the csv file has an 
                  header, and the separation type as an input and returns the
                  data.
     calculate_and_export_means: operates on a range of columns, calculating the
                                 mean for each column and exporting the results 
                                 to a CSV file named "table_mean.csv" by
                                 default.
     run_lm_workflow: Creates a linear regression model workflow that predicts 
                      the community well-being scores for various Canadian 
                      communities, and outputs a table of the model's summary.
